* Module 1

### Scenerio 
We have a homogenous mixture of environments based on cloud as well as on-premise Kubernetes clusters. Some of our applications run on multiple instances while others are standalone. The configuration of the auxiliary services (databases, caches etc) might be different depending on the environment. Design a pipeline that fits the needs of such an infrastructure for our app. (Github actions, helm ,argocd are preferred).

### Designing Architecture:
Designing a pipeline for an infrastructure with a mixture of cloud and on-premise Kubernetes clusters, varying application instances, and different auxiliary service configurations is a complex task. Below are key points and a high-level design architecture for such a pipeline:

Considering the GitOps best practices of separating your Application Source Code from the Applicationâ€™s K8s Configuration in two Git(Hub) repositories, Here are the process to implement the CI/CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery) with GitHub Actions (CI) and pull based deployment via Argo CD.

The workflow I am using which can be easily converted to Continuous Delivery by modifying the GitHub Actions. 

Continuous Deployment is ideal for lower environments (i.e. Development) and can be triggered by a PR merge, push or even a simple commit to the application source code repository wheres Continous Delivery would require the manual approval to proceed with production cluster or env. 

## Pseudocode of Pipeline and ArgoCD

### Steps
1. Here User is check-in the code to repo1 or create PR and that will trigger the GITHUB ACTION WORKFLOW 1 (CI Pipeline) by  the modification of event. **Assumption** The ECR creds to store container image is already in the CI pipeline (GITHUB ACTION WORKFLOW 1)
2. The GITHUB ACTION WORKFLOW 1 will run steps mentioned in pipeline i.e. build, compile, and test your application and then package it in a Docker container and publish it to a container repository.
3. The GITHUB ACTION WORKFLOW 1 passes the Docker image name and tag as input and triggers the  GITHUB ACTION WORKFLOW 2, which will update the helm chart's dev or prod wrapper manifest file and commit and push the changes to the Application/K8s Configuration repository. 
4. Argo CD will be pulling this change and update the application on the K8s cluster.
5. We will be using "sync app" as manual for production and automatic for development.
6. The default rolling update will take place, and which we can see in the Argo CD UI that the new version being deployed first and then the containers running the old version being terminated after.


**CI/CD In Motion**
- GITHUB ACTION WORKFLOW 1 acts as the CI flow, resides on the Application git repository, and is designed to trigger on code updates initiated by user; it will build the Docker container and push it to the ECR in this scenario. In addition, this flow will trigger Pipleine2 and pass the newly built image tag.

- GITHUB ACTION WORKFLOW 2 (CD Pipeline) is the CD flow, resides on the Helm Chart Configuration git repository, and is initiated at the end of GITHUB ACTION WORKFLOW 1 completion; it will take the latest built image tag form GITHUB ACTION WORKFLOW 1 and update the Helm's dev or prod wrapper manifest file with it, which in turn will wake up ArgoCD and redeploy the latest application.


* How the tag version will get update in k8 configuration repository. 
- The logic behind is very simple. The GITHUB ACTION WORKFLOW 1 will run all steps and last step will send tag version as payload and trigger the GITHUB ACTION WORKFLOW 2 to start. Then next moment the GITHUB ACTION WORKFLOW 2 will initate and take the payload tag version and update in helm chart's dev or prod wrapper manifest file. 


#### Sample dev-values.yaml and prod-values.yaml
======================================
```
Dev-Value.yaml
  image:$Image (Pick from workflow 1 job)
  cluster:
    dev
      Cloud
  Auto-deploy - ON 
  

Prod-Value.yaml
  image:$Image (Pick from workflow 1 job)
  cluster:
    Prod
      Onprem
      Cloud
  Auto-deploy - Off (Manual Approval required)
```
  

### Best Practice Implementation 

**Rollback Mechanism** - Argo CD Rollbacks can be easily triggered from the UI or CLI, but the idea of GitOps is to rely on Git and revert your changes and let the CI/Argo CD do its magic. Argo CD deployment strategies aka Rollouts include blue-green and canary among others.

**Logging and Monitoring** - Set up logging and monitoring for all clusters and applications. Tools like Prometheus and Grafana can be used for this purpose.

**Security Consideration**
We also can limit in GutHub who can commit to the repo (application and K8s config repos), who can review and merge pull requests, etc. 

**Secret Management**: Implement a secure method for managing secrets and sensitive configurations. Tools like HashiCorp Vault or Kubernetes Secrets can be integrated into your pipeline.

**Documentation and Runbooks**: Maintain comprehensive documentation and runbooks for the pipeline, covering deployment procedures, environment-specific configurations, and troubleshooting steps.

**Audit and Compliance**: Ensure compliance with security and audit requirements in your pipeline. Implement measures for auditing and tracking changes to the infrastructure.
